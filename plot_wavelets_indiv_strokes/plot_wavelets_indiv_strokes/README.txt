Want to see:

- similarity in wavelets for same strokes "e", "e", etc.

- difference in wavelets for different strokes "e", "r", etc.

It seems that acceleration (acc_x, etc.) and gyroscope (gyr_x, ...) have the most information about strokes, so start with those.


For the "marie" data:

- load data

- split into individual strokes

- for each _unique_ stroke:

-   plot some examples of that unique stroke on one page, next to each other
