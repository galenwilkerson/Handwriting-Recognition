# Handwriting Recognition using Machine Learning and Signal Processing 

This was for a paid project (so data cannot be published) to use data from an inertial measurement unit (IMU) as an input source for handwriting recognition.

That is, the device would generate acceleration and magnetic signals, which could then be classified using machine learning techniques, to try to predict characters that were written.

These folders contain many experiments on the data to understand it, including statistics, visualization, and classification, trying out various features to check how they improve classification accuracy.

Python and R were used, as well as signal processing and machine learning libraries (scikit learn).
