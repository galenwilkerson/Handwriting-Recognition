Run neural network on data, 
first do basic testing

do many-fold testing, 
plot confusion matrix

Run in this order:

- python2.7 preprocess.py
- python2.7 ANN.py
- python2.7 check_predictions.py


Note that num_resamplings parameter of preprocess_data function determines how many times to sample from the interpolated spline.
