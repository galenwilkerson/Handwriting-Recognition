# Machine-Learning-Signal-Processing-and-Handwriting-Recognition

This was for a paid project (so data cannot be published) to use data from an inertial measurement unit (IMU) as an input source for handwriting recognition.

That is, the device would generate acceleration and magnetic signals, which could then be classified using machine learning techniques, to try to predict characters that were written.
